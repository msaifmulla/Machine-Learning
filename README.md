# Machine-Learning
Online Certification of MACHINE LEARNING 

This repository showcases my learning and project work from the Online Machine Learning Internship at CODETECH IT Solutions.
Throughout the internship, I worked on:

Data preprocessing and analysis

Supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms

Model training, evaluation, and optimization

Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn

The goal of this internship was to build a strong foundation in machine learning through practical, real-world tasks.
